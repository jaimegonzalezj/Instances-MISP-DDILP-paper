# Instances for the Maximum Independent Set Problem (MISP)

This set of 700 MISP Instances is used in the computational experiments of the following paper:

- JE Gonzalez, A. Cire, A. Lodi, and LM Rousseau. Integrated Integer Programming and Decision Diagram Search Tree, with an Application to the Maximum Independent Set Problem. Under review in Constraints.

The instance file name corresponds to id-fam-n-p.txt where:
- id: id number of the instance
- fam: family according to the random graph generation model used to generate the instance
- n: number of nodes in the undirected graph
- p: density of the undirected graph
