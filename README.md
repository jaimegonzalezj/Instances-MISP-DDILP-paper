# Instances for the Maximum Independent Set Problem (MISP)

This set of 700 MISP instances is used in the computational experiments of the following paper:

- JE Gonzalez, A. Cire, A. Lodi, and LM Rousseau. Integrated Integer Programming and Decision Diagram Search Tree with an Application to the Maximum Independent Set Problem.

The instance filename (id-fam-n-p.txt) corresponds to:
- id: id number of the instance
- fam: family according to the random graph generation model used to generate the instance
- n: number of nodes in the undirected graph
- p: density of the undirected graph
